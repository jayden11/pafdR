<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p><strong>In the digital era, information is abundant and cheap</strong>. From the ever-changing price of financial contracts to the unstructured data of social media websites, the high volume of information we observe in the workplace creates a strong need for data analysis. A company or organization benefits immensely when it can create a bridge between raw information from its environment and making strategic decisions. Undoubtedly, this is a prolific time for professionals skilled in using the right tools for acquiring, storing, and analysing data.</p>
<p>In particular, datasets related to Economy and Finance are widely available to the public. International and local institutions, such as central banks, national research agencies, financial exchanges, and many others, provide their data publicly, either by legal obligation or to foment research. Whether you are looking into statistics for a particular country or a company, most information is just a couple of clicks away. By analysing this information efficiently, you’ll be able to offer valuable insights to your team.</p>
<p>Technological advancements were accompanied by a decrease in computational cost. Today, home computers can process massive amounts of data in a short while, making it accessible to anyone. The methods applied to the data have also advanced in complexity. While in the past, a simple spreadsheet can do the job; today, the situation is different. For areas of knowledge with practical applications, such as Economy and Finance, it is expected that a graduate student or a data analyst has learned at least one programming language that allows him to do his work in an efficient manner. Learning how to program is becoming a requisite for the job market.</p>
<p>In this setup, the role of R, a programming language aimed to solve computational problems involving data analysis, shines. In the following sections, we will explain what R is and why you should use it .</p>
<div id="what-is-r" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What is R</h2>
<p>R is a programming language specially designed to resolve statistical problems and allow the graphical display of data. R is a GNU version of S, a programming language originally created in Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies). The base code of R was developed by two academics, <strong>Ross Ihaka</strong> and <strong>Robert Gentleman</strong>, resulting in the programming platform we have today. For anyone curious about the name, the letter R was chosen due to the common first letter of the name of their creators.  </p>
<p>Today, R is almost synonymous to data analysis, with a large user base and defined packages that extend its use. It is likely that researchers from various fields, from Economics to Biology, find in R significant preexisting code that facilitates their analysis. In the business side, large and established companies, such as <em>Google</em> and <em>Microsoft</em>, already adopted R as the internal language for data analysis. R is maintained by <a href="https://www.r-project.org/foundation/"><strong>R Foundation</strong></a> and the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/"><strong>R Consortium</strong></a>, a collective effort to fund projects for extending the programming language.  </p>
</div>
<div id="why-choose-r" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Why Choose R</h2>
<p>Learning a new programming language requires a lot of time and effort. Perhaps you’re wondering why you should opt for R and invest time in learning it. Here are the main arguments.</p>
<p>First, <strong>R is a mature, stable platform, continuously supported and intensively used in the industry</strong>. When choosing R, you will have the computational background not only for an academic career in scientific research, but also to work as a data analyst in private organizations. If you are a student, learning R will create more options for your future career. Also, the strong support from the community means it very unlikely the R platform will ever fade away or be substituted for something else. Depending on your career choices, R might be the only programming language you ever need to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Learning R is easy</strong>. My experience in teaching R allows me to say students, even those with no programming experience, have no problem learning the language and using it to create their own code. The language is intuitive and certain rules and functions can be extended to different cases. For example, function <code>print</code> is used to show the contents of an object on the screen. You can use it for any kind of object as it adapts to the class of the object. So, by learning it one time, you’ll be able to apply it in many different scenarios. Once you understand how the program works, it is easy to discover new features starting from a previous logic. This generic notation facilitates the learning process.</p>
<p><strong>The engine of R and the interface of RStudio creates a highly productive environment</strong>. The graphical interface provided by RStudio facilitates the use of R and increases productivity. By combining both, the user has at his disposal many tools that facilitate the use of the platform. </p>
<p><strong>R is compatible with different operating systems and it can interface with different programming languages</strong>. If you need to use a code in other programming language, such as <em>C++</em>, <em>Python</em>, <em>Julia</em>, it is easy to integrate it with R. Therefore, the user is not restricted to a single language and can use features and functions from other platforms. The possibility of using other programming languages within R is part of its functionalities.   </p>
<p><strong>R is free!</strong> The main software and all its packages are free to use. For most packages, the user’s license gives you freedom to use and modify the code freely in your work. This supports the adoption of the R language in a business environment, where obtaining individual and collective licenses of commercial software can cause a high financial cost. Not surprisingly, R is used in a large number of companies.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-can-you-do-with-r-and-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> What Can You Do With R and RStudio?</h2>
<p>R is a fairly complete programming language and any computational problem can be solved based on it. Given the adoption of R for different areas of knowledge, the list is extensive. With finance, I highlight the following possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Import, export, process, and store financial data based on local files or the internet;</p></li>
<li><p>Substitute and improve data intensive tasks from spreadsheet like software;</p></li>
<li><p>Develop routines for managing and controlling investment portfolios and executing financial orders;</p></li>
<li><p>Implementation of various possibilities of empirical research through statistical tools, such as econometric models and hypothesis testing;</p></li>
<li><p>Create dynamic <em>websites</em> with the <code>Shiny</code> package, allowing anyone in the world to use a financial tool created by you; </p></li>
<li><p>Create an automated process of developing technical financial reports with package <code>knitr</code>; </p></li>
<li><p>Write a technical book with <code>bookdown</code>; </p></li>
<li><p>Write and publish a blog about finance with <code>blogdown</code>; </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the previously highlighted uses, public access to packages developed by users further expands these capabilities. The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Finance.html">CRAN website</a> offers a <em>Task Views</em> panel for the topic of Finance. On this page, you can find the main packages available to perform specific operations in Finance. This includes importing financial data from the internet, estimating econometric model, calculation of different risk estimates, among many other possibilities. Reading this page and the knowledge of these packages is essential for those who intend to work in Finance. It is worth noting, however, this list contains only the main items. The complete list of packages related to Finance is much larger than shown in <em>Task Views</em>. The link to the CRAN site is available on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pmfdr/home">book page</a>. In this book, we will cover many packages from the task view in finance.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Installing R and RStudio</h2>
<p>Before going further, let’s install the required software on your computer. R is installed on your operating system like any other program. The most direct and practical way to install it is to go to <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R website</a> and click the <em>Download</em> link in the left side of the page, as shown in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:website-cran-1">1.1</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:website-cran-1"></span>
<img src="figs/website_cran_1.png" alt="Initial page for downloading R" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.1: Initial page for downloading R
</p>
</div>
<p>The next screen gives you a choice of mirror to download the installation files. The CRAN repository (<em>R Comprehensive Archive network</em>) is mirrored in various parts of the world to improve the access speed. You can choose one of the links from the nearest location to you. If undecided, just select the mirror <em>0-Cloud</em>, as show in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:website-cran-2">1.2</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:website-cran-2"></span>
<img src="figs/website_cran_2.png" alt="Choosing the CRAN mirror" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.2: Choosing the CRAN mirror
</p>
</div>
<p>The next step involves selecting your operating system. This is likely to be <em>Windows</em>. Due to the greater popularity of this platform, from now on, we will focus on installing R in Windows. The instructions for installing R in other operating systems can be easily found <a href="https://www.google.com.br/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=installing+r&amp;*">online</a>. Regardless of the underlying platform, using R is about the same. There are a few exceptions, especially when R interacts with the file system. In the content of the book, special care was taken to choose functions that work the same way in different operating systems. A few exceptions are highlighted throughout the book. So, even if you are using Mac or Linux, you can take full advantage of the material presented here .</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:website-cran-3"></span>
<img src="figs/website_cran_3.png" alt="Choosing the operating system" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.3: Choosing the operating system
</p>
</div>
<p>After clicking the link <em>Download R for Windows</em>, as in Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:website-cran-3">1.3</a>, the next screen will show the following download options: <em>base</em>, <em>contrib</em>, <em>old.contrib</em> and <em>RTools</em>. Among the <em>download</em> options, the first (<em>base</em>), should be selected. It contains the basic installation of R in <em>Windows</em>. If the user is interested in creating and distributing their own R packages, it is necessary to install <em>RTools</em>. For most users, however, this should not be the case, so I suggest ignoring this program. The links to <em>contrib</em> and <em>old.contrib</em> relate to files for the current and old releases of R packages. You should not worry about it for now. We will discuss the use of packages in the next chapter.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:website-cran-4"></span>
<img src="figs/website_cran_4.png" alt="Installation options" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.4: Installation options
</p>
</div>
<p>After clicking the link <em>base</em>, the next screen will show the link to the <em>download</em> of the R installation file (Figure <a href="introduction.html#fig:website-cran-5">1.5</a>). After downloading the file, open it and follow the steps in the installation screen. At this time, no special configuration is required. I suggest keeping all the default choices and simply hit <em>accept</em> in the displayed dialogue screens. After the installation of R, it is strongly recommended to install RStudio, which will be addressed next .</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:website-cran-5"></span>

<p>The base installation of R includes its own <em>GUI</em> (graphical user interface) that facilitates the use of the program. However, this native interface has several limitations. RStudio is a software that substitutes the original interface and makes the access to R more practical and efficient. One way to understand this relationship is with an analogy with cars. While R is the engine of the programming language, RStudio is the body and instrument panel, which significantly improve the user experience. Besides presenting a more attractive look, RStudio also adds several features that make the life of a programmer easier, allowing the creation of projects and packages, creation of dynamic documents (<em>Sweave/knitr</em>), among others. As an example, the book you are reading was written in RStudio with package <code>bookdown</code>.  </p>
<p>The installation of RStudio is simpler than that of R. The files are available in <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio website</a>, provided in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pmfdr/home">book site</a>. After accessing the page, click <em>Download RStudio</em> and then <em>Download RStudio Desktop</em>. After that, just select the installation file relative to the operating system on which you will work. This option is probably <em>WINDOWS Vista 7/8/10</em>. Note that, as well as R, RStudio is also available for alternative platforms.</p>
<p>I emphasize that using RStudio is not essential to develop programs in R. Other interface software are available and can be used. However, in my experience, RStudio is the interface that offers the widest range of features for the language and is widely used, which justifies its choice.</p>

<p>The R community is vivid and engaging. There are many authors, such as myself, that constantly release material about R in their blogs and are happy to discuss it. It includes package announcements, posts about data analysis in real life, curiosities, rants and tutorials. <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a> is a website that aggregates these blogs in a single place, making it easier for anyone to access and participate. I strongly recommend to sign up for the R-Bloggers feed in <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/RBloggers">RSS</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rbloggers/?fref=ts">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Rbloggers">Twitter</a>. Not only you’ll be informed of what is happening in the R community, but also learn a lot by reading other people code and articles.</p>
<p>Learning and using R can be a social experience. Several conferences and user-groups are available in many countries. You can find the complete list in this <a href="https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/index.html">link</a>. I also suggest looking for local groups in Facebook. These may not be registered in the previous link.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Structure and Organization</h2>
<p>This book presents a practical approach to the use of R in finance, accompanied by R code, which will show and illustrate the functionality of the program. To get the most out of this book, I suggest you first seek to understand the code shown, and only then, try using it on your own computer.</p>
<p>Learning to program in a new language is like learning a foreign spoken language: the use in day-to-day problems is imperative to create fluency. All the code and data used in this book is available in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pmfdr/home">book webpage</a>. I suggest you test the code on your computer and <em>play</em> with it, modifying the examples and checking the effect of changes in the outputs. Whenever you have a computational problem, try using R for solving it. You’ll stumble and make mistakes at first. But I guarantee that, soon enough, you’ll be able to write complex data tasks effortlessly.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, every demonstration of code will have two parts: the R code and its output. The output is nothing more than the result of the commands in the program screen. All inputs and outputs code will be marked in the text with a special format. See the following example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># create a list</span>
x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">list</span>(<span class="st">&#39;abc&#39;</span>, <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="st">&#39;dec&#39;</span>)

<span class="co"># print list</span>
<span class="kw">print</span>(x)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] &quot;abc&quot;
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] &quot;dec&quot;</code></pre>
<p>For the previous chunk of code, lines <code>x &lt;- list('abc', 1:5, 'dec')</code> and <code>print(x)</code> are actual commands given to R. The program output is the on-screen presentation of the contents of object <code>x</code> with the predecessor symbol <code>##</code>. This symbol is used for any code output. Notice also that inline comments are set with the symbol <code>#</code>. Anything in the right side of <code>#</code> is not evaluated by R. These comments serve as written notes about the code.</p>
<p>Code can also be spatially organized using new lines. This is a common procedure around arguments of functions. The next chunk of code is equivalent to the previous, and will run the exact same way. Notice how we used a new line to vertically align the arguments of function <code>list</code>. You’ll soon see that, throughout the book, this type of vertical alignment is constantly used.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># create a list</span>
x &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">list</span>(<span class="st">&#39;abc&#39;</span>, 
          <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="dv">5</span>, 
          <span class="st">&#39;dec&#39;</span>)

<span class="co"># print list</span>
<span class="kw">print</span>(x)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] &quot;abc&quot;
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] &quot;dec&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The code also follows a well-defined structure. One decision in writing computer code is how to name objects and how to structure it. It is recommended to follow a clear pattern, so it is easy to maintain over time and be used and understood by others. For this book, a mixture of the author’s personal choices with the coding style suggested by Google (link on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pmfdr/home">book website</a>) was used. The reader, however, may choose the structure he finds more efficient and aesthetically pleasing. Like many things in life, this is a choice.</p>
